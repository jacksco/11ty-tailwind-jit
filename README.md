# 11ty-tailwind-jit
A static site generator that works with Eleventy + Tailwind-JIT + Webpack5


1. Run `npm install` to download all the dependencies in package.json
2. Run `npm run dev` from your terminal app. You can then view the site in http://localhost:3000 on your computer.


3. Run `npm run build` to generate the final files


`main.js` is setup to show how code-splitting and how it might be used for loading in your own scripts.
